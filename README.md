# Yaksplained â€“ All the SerenityOS Yaks, explained!

This heavily relates to [SerenityOS](http://www.serenityos.org).

## On Yakshaving and Serenity's Love of Yaks

Yakshaving refers to doing work that seems pointless but is necessary to achieve a goal later down the line. In the SerenityOS developer community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/serenity), yakshaving is pretty prevalent (after all, building a new operating system requires a bunch of seemingly pointless gruntwork). Yak kind of became synonymous with just "the thing that I'm working on" or "the Serenity-intenal project I have". Therefore, the entire yak thing got out of hand and quite quickly, the Unicode bison emoji (the closest thing to a yak) wasn't enough anmore. So people created more yak emojis. And more yak emojis. And more yak emojis...

## All the Yaks Explained

Note that most of this is based on my personal observations, and while I can remember about half of these being created, I'll most certainly be wrong in how they are used in one place or another. Order is alphabetical.

### Hairyak: How did this grow so fast?

![](hairyak.png)

This one's a hairy yak to shave. Used for particularly difficult/cumbersome/long-winded problems.

Created by sin-ack on August 24th, 2021. Reason: Andreas requested a "particularly hairy yak" [(first message in the chain)](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/879746499108556881).

### Imminentyakshave: This yak's about to be shaved.

![](imminentyakshave.png)

Shave incoming. Used for when you're about to solve/currently solving a problem. Or if you noticed a problem and want to solve it right now.

Created by sin-ack before July 18th, 2021. Reason: unknown. Also relevant: [the associated meme](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/867538791962378240).

### Neoyak: Hax0r

![](neoyak.png)

Hacker terminal or coding-themed yak, for all your hacker needs. Used in conjunction with Terminal or pop culture hacker-related things. Also used as a ninja yak when something ninja-related comes up.

Created by sin-ack on June 6th, 2021. Reason: symbols for the bot's LibJS test262 runner status. Here, it is used for all the tests that caused a runner exception. Starting with [this message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/851168937131638784), and with encouragement by networkException a conversation commenced that led to the creation of custom emojis for all the test runner results. _These emojis will be referred to here as the neoyak group._

### Skeleyak: That's an old one.

![](skeleyak.png)

When one of your yaks is really old or just has been sitting around for a long time.

Created by sin-ack on June 6th, 2021. Reason: symbols for the bot's LibJS test262 runner status, part of the _neoyak_ group. Here, it is used for all the tests that timed out. See [this message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/851176393000747089).

### Sleepyak: Zzzzz...

![](sleepyak.png)

Don't wake the yak. A general sleep emoji.

Created by sin-ack on July 30th, 2021. Reason: unknown. [First version's message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/870589889320742932).

### Yakbait: Nerd Snipe.

![](yakbait.png)

A yak just baiting you to be shaved. Serenity's version of the [nerd snipe](https://xkcd.com/356/).

Created by sin-ack on August 8th, 2021. Reason: unknown. The similarity to the nerd snipe was first mentioned by networkException a couple of days later [(this message)](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/859531354219872266/875851312686825564).

### Yakbrain: 5Head

![](yakbrain.png)

That's smart. Comparable use to the 5Head emoji.

Created by (probably?) Andreas on August 14th, 2021. Reason: unknown.

### Yakfire: \*smiles\* This is fine!

![](yakfire.png)

Something just blew up/went wrong, or you found a fun bug. Can also be used as a "This is fine!" analog.

Created by Andreas on July 1st, 2021. Reason: Brian requested a ["Yak/Buggie wrapped in a warm blanket sipping Earl Grey in front of a fire emoji"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/851522357734408232/860261769577234452) and Andreas made yakfire instead because it wouldn't be as complicated. "Interpretation left to the viewer".

### Yakfused: Yak is confusion.

![](yakfused.png)

Generic confusion emoji.

Created by sin-ack on June 8th, 2021. Reason: In response to an admittedly [weird comment by Ali](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/851522357734408232/851871356051521546), sin-ack used the non-existing catdogconfused, to which Andreas responded with the then-non-existing yakfused. This was promptly created by sin-ack.

### Yakketysax: \*jazz noises\*

![](yakketysax.png)

A musical yak. "For when you're chasing a yak around all day and getting nowhere."

Created by Sam Atkins on August 18th, 2021. Reason: [the aforementioned purpose](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831144706079195176/877495085191794699).

### Yakminus: `yakstack.pop()`

![](yakminus.png)

You just managed to finish work on something. One yak is off the stack!

Created by sin-ack on June 27th, 2021. Reason: unknown [(this message)](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/858635750970359808). They first mentioned the idea on June 14th [here](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/854076622365655060).

### Yakoverflow: The programmer's favorite website.

![](yakoverflow.png)

A pun on Stack Overflow, obviously. When the yak stack gets too large.

Created by (probably?) Andreas before June 17th, 2021. Reason: unknown.

### Yakplus: `yakstack.push(new Yak())`

![](yakplus.png)

You found a problem you want to work on. There's a new yak for your stack!

Created by (probably?) Andreas before June 14th, 2021. Reason: unknown.

### Yakshed: ~~who tf even came up with this~~

![](yakshed.png)

A combination of yak shaving and bikeshedding. The latter refers to [procrastination or investing time into unimportant issues](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding) (as opposed to yakshaving, where time is invested into only _seemingly_ unimportant issues). The emoji can be used when the distinction is not exactly clear.

Created by Andreas (probably?) before July 21st, 2021. Reason: unknown.

### Yakshrug: idk man

![](yakshrug.png)

Serenity's shrug emoji. People have mentioned that it looks kind of creepy.

Created by sin-ack on July 31st, 2021. Reason: Andreas responded to [their use of a shrug emoji](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830739873119207426/870797713439072308) with the then-non-existent yakshrug, which resulted in the creation of the emoji.

### Yakslice: \*surprised yak sounds\*

![](yakslice.png)

This yak was just split up. Used when things go wrong in general, or if the yak just got deeper.

Created by sin-ack on June 6th, 2021. Reason: symbols for the bot's LibJS test262 runner status, part of the _neoyak_ group. Here, it is used for all the tests that encounter a harness error. See [this message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/851180017261346866).

### Yaksplode: \*even more surprised yak sounds\*

![](yaksplode.png)

Yak go boom. Similar in use to yakslice, used when things go wrong. Especially for crashes and the likes.

Created by sin-ack on June 6th, 2021: Reason: symbols for the bot's LibJS test262 runner status, part of the _neoyak_ group. Here, it is used for all the tests that encounter a (regular) error. See [this message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/851172304959307777).

### Yakstack: But that's already on the stack

![](yakstack.png)

Refers to the stuff you want to do in Serenity, your to-do list etc. Used similar to yakoverflow, just in general when referencing all of the many things that are to be done.

Created by (probably?) Andreas before June 17th, 2021. Reason: unknown.

### Yaktangle: Well... this got out of control.

![](yaktangle.png)

A box of hair. Used for the most difficult/cumbersome/long-winded problems.

Created by sin-ack on August 24th, 2021 together with _hairyak_.

### Yakthonk: Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

![](yakthonk.png)

Serenity's thonk emoji, for when something is very strange/interesting.

Created by (probably?) Andreas before August 19th, 2021. Reason: unknown. The idea was previously mentioned by him on June 8th, 2021 [here](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/851874120148451350).
