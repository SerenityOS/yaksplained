# Yaksplained â€“ All the SerenityOS Yaks, explained!

This heavily relates to [SerenityOS](http://www.serenityos.org).

## On Yakshaving and Serenity's Love of Yaks

Yakshaving refers to doing work that seems pointless but is necessary to achieve a goal later down the line. In the SerenityOS developer community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/serenity), yakshaving is pretty prevalent (after all, building a new operating system requires a bunch of seemingly pointless gruntwork). Yak kind of became synonymous with just "the thing that I'm working on" or "the Serenity-intenal project I have". Therefore, the entire yak thing got out of hand and quite quickly, the Unicode bison emoji (the closest thing to a yak) wasn't enough anymore. So people created more yak emojis. And more yak emojis. And more yak emojis...

## All the Yaks Explained

Note that most of this is based on my personal observations, and while I can remember about half of these being created, I'll most certainly be wrong in how they are used in one place or another. Order is alphabetical.

#### Regarding private channel links

Some complaints have come up about the links to private channels which explain the origins of various emojis. We have decided that providing any evidence here is better than providing no evidence, even if the only evidence is not publicly available. If you have a good reason, we (in particular kleines FilmrÃ¶llchen) can provide you possibly censored screenshots of mentioned conversations.

### 8bityak: \*chiptune starts playing\*

![8bityak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/928632967545368616.png)

A retro yak for all your nostalgia needs.

Created by Sam on or before February 28th, 2013, added as an emoji by Andreas on January 6th, 2022. The yak was created by Sam for his [yak game](https://github.com/AtkinsSJ/yak) ([play online if you have flash](http://samatkins.co.uk/games/yak/)) [as part of a game jam in 2013](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/928700382551625818), and Andreas uncovered it on the date he created the emoji ([this message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/928630761626664971) (private channel)).

### Babyak: it's so cuuute

![babyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/929500826240696350.png)

A baby-faced yak that represents very young people (or yaks, for that matter).

Created by Andreas on January 8th, 2022. Reason: in a discussion, he noticed that someone was [less than 15 years old](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/929499581123805184) (private channel), to which Daniel responded with ":babyak:" and Andreas created the emoji.

### Goldyak: shineh shineh trophey

![goldyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/894236717421318144.png)

A trophy-like shiny yak, for giving out awards when someone shaved a difficult yak.

Created by Andreas on October 3rd, 2021. Reason: In response to (probably) some bug fix description, he wrote ["if it works, that's a golden yak for you"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/886211697843531866/894235121933254696). Apparently it did work, because shortly after that, he posted the newly-created :goldyak:. The details here are a bit fuzzy, see [this message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/896476288167071824).

### Hairyak: How did this grow so fast?

![hairyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/879749569964015646.png)

This one's a hairy yak to shave. Used for particularly difficult/cumbersome/long-winded problems.

Created by Agni on August 24th, 2021. Reason: Andreas requested a "particularly hairy yak" [(first message in the chain)](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/879746499108556881).

### Imminentyakshave: This yak's about to be shaved.

![imminentyakshave](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/866030445388365884.png)

Shave incoming. Used for when you're about to solve/currently solving a problem. Or if you noticed a problem and want to solve it right now.

Created by Agni on July 17th, 2021. Reason: [requested by Andreas](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/865881764111450112). Also relevant: [the associated meme](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/867538791962378240).

### Neoyak: Hax0r

![neoyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/851188922512048199.png)

Hacker terminal or coding-themed yak, for all your hacker needs. Used in conjunction with Terminal or pop culture hacker-related things. Also used as a ninja yak when something ninja-related comes up.

Created by Agni on June 6th, 2021. Reason: symbols for the bot's LibJS test262 runner status. Here, it is used for all the tests that caused a runner exception. Starting with [this message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/851168937131638784), and with encouragement by networkException a conversation commenced that led to the creation of custom emojis for all the test runner results. _These emojis will be referred to here as the neoyak group._

### Partyak: Congratulations!

![partyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/901168038248874045.png)

This yak is having a party, compare to the default (i.e. Unicode) ðŸ¥³ emoji.

Created by Andreas on October 21st, 2021. Reason: [celebration of the :yakking: emoji](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830522505605283866/900713226810064967) (see below).

### Reyakted: This yak is named \[REDACTED\], it was born on â– â– â– â– â– â– â– .

![reyakted](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/896486220106956810.png)

(Note to the RFC editor: Insert an SCP joke here.)

Created by Linus on October 9th, 2021. Reason: After discussing the :goldyak: origins (see above) with [Linus' blacked-out screenshot](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/896476288167071824), Sam asked [":reyakted: emote wen?"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/896484164059156490) and Linus promptly created it. 

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD08`

### Shavedyak: \*shivers\*

![shavedyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/919968342368993301.png)

A completely shaved or even naked yak. The ultimate endpoint in the yakshaving sequence.

Created by Agni on December 13th, 2021. Reason: While he was working on yakmail (see below), he apparently deleted the entire hair, [creating shavedyak accidentally](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/919965580365287455). Linus was quick to point out that ["This is cursed, I'd be happy to add it as :shavedyak:"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/919966596460589096).

### Skeleyak: That's an old one.

![skeleyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/851188921290457150.png)

When one of your yaks is really old or just has been sitting around for a long time.

Created by Agni on June 6th, 2021. Reason: symbols for the bot's LibJS test262 runner status, part of the _neoyak_ group. Here, it is used for all the tests that timed out. See [this message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/851176393000747089).

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD14`

### Sleepyak: Zzzzz...

![sleepyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/870598400016535554.png)

Don't wake the yak. A general sleep emoji.

Created by Agni on July 30th, 2021. Reason: unknown. [First version's message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/870589889320742932).

### Thousandyakstare: Oh god, it's looking at me

![thousandyakstare](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/931283776850505759.png)

The stare of a thousand yaks. Are they in anger or rage, or are they just annoyed or tired? I don't know.

Created by Andreas on January 13th, 2022. Reason: After discussing the transfer of this very repository to the SerenityOS organization, kleines FilmrÃ¶llchen said ["I'll just scream at you when something's amiss, sound good?"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/931286643346927627) (private channel) and Andreas responded with the newly created emoji as "you \[kleines\] provided the perfect opportunity to try it out!". The idea for the emoji must be a bit older, because on January 5th Andreas responded to Tobias' [posting of a very complex CSS spec image](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525031720943627/928398680443224104) with the then-nonexistent :thousandyakstare:.

### Xmasyak: Yakky Holidays!

![xmasyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/915529868219940944.png)

A christmas-themed yak, partially inspired by the fact that many people add a santa hat to their avatar in December.

Created by Andreas before December 1st, 2021. Reason: probably the above, or the question for a "SerenityOS Winter Holiday Theme". [This message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830522505605283866/915406501760348170) is the first to include xmasyak as a reaction.

### Yakbait: Nerd Snipe.

![yakbait](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/873672505309679758.png)

A yak just baiting you to be shaved. Serenity's version of the [nerd snipe](https://xkcd.com/356/).

Created by Andreas on August 7th, 2021. Reason: Andrew commented ["don't yak bait me I'm trying to work on the build system lol"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/873671201262817290) (private channel). The similarity to the nerd snipe was first mentioned by networkException a couple of days later [(this message)](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/859531354219872266/875851312686825564).

### Yakblush: \*turns red and starts to stutter\*

![yakblush](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/921153579266498590.png)

A blushing yak emote like the Unicode ðŸ˜Š.

Created by Agni on December 16th, 2021. Reason: after discussing the ages of contributors, Brian remarked that ["Damn, serenity has a lot of Wunderkinds"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/921149719747625040) (private channel), to which Daniel responded with ":yakblush:". Agni quickly joined in with the newly created Yakblush emoji. [This](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830718394768162837/921724736009011251) is the first public message containing it.

### Yakbrain: 5Head

![yakbrain](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/853957472607273001.png)

### Yakchain: \*stampede approaching\*

![yakchain](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/887111540967366677.png)

There's a yak, that leads to another yak, that leads to another yak, ... and so on.

Created by Mustafa on September 13th, 2021. Reason: A discussion about blockchain and microkernels (don't ask).

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD91`

### Yakea: Everyone's favorite Swedish furniture.

![yakea](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/888202246301569064.png)

A yak in the style of [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/), the infamous Swedish furniture company that has come to kind of (ironically and unironically) represent Sweden internationally. A reference to the fact that Andreas is Swedish.

Created by Linus on September 17th, 2021. Reason: In the discussion that ensued from the announcement of :yakid2: (see below), Sam mentioned that the emoji looked like ["BjÃ¶rn, the yak from Ikea"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/888193041091928074), to which Andreas responded "Yakea\*" and during a chain of Yak-Ikea-related jokes, Linus created the emoji.

### Yakfire: \*smiles\* This is fine!

![yakfire](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/860262878984536065.png)

Something just blew up/went wrong, or you found a fun bug. Can also be used as a "This is fine!" analog.

Created by Andreas on July 1st, 2021. Reason: Brian requested a ["Yak/Buggie wrapped in a warm blanket sipping Earl Grey in front of a fire emoji"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/851522357734408232/860261769577234452) and Andreas made yakfire instead because it wouldn't be as complicated. "Interpretation left to the viewer".

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD0F`

### Yakfused: Yak is confusion.

![yakfused](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/851873832003960833.png?v=1)

Generic confusion emoji.

Created by Agni on June 8th, 2021. Reason: In response to an admittedly [weird comment by Ali](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/851522357734408232/851871356051521546), Agni used the non-existing catdogconfused, to which Andreas responded with the then-non-existing yakfused. This was promptly created by Agni.

### Yakid2: CSS is my passion

![yakid2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/888189245594931202.png)

~~oh god where do I start~~ [ACID2](https://www.webstandards.org/files/acid2/test.html) is a popular test page that tests the compliance of a web browser, mainly CSS. The test is set up in such a way that only when the browser is (almost) compliant, a perfect smiley face will appear; otherwise, elements of the face are shifted, wrongly sized etc. For some time now, an ACID2 emoji :acid2:has existed on the server, demonstrating Browser's current compliance level. As to be expected, it still looks pretty bad:

![acid2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/908128059687837776.png)

Yakid2 is then just a yak emoji in the vein of the ACID2 emoji.

Created by Andreas before September 17th, 2021. Reason: Unknown. First mentioned publicly by Linus [here](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/888190475956281374).

### Yakketysax: \*jazz noises\*

![yakketysax](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/877495327635157053.png)

A musical yak. "For when you're chasing a yak around all day and getting nowhere."

Created by Sam Atkins on August 18th, 2021. Reason: [the aforementioned purpose](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831144706079195176/877495085191794699).

### Yakking: The king of yaks

![yakking](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/900686373844025364.png)

Created by networkException on October 21th, 2021. Reason: Agni welcomed Andreas back with "welcome back king". Andreas responded with "right back at you yak king" which Agni responded to with "ðŸ¦¬ ðŸ‘‘".

### Yakkiss: /Ê˜/

![yakkiss](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/883457694789406732.png?v=1)

Delicious, approved by yak. Used as a replacement for the chef kiss emoji (which also exists on the server), in particular when relating to code.

Created by Andreas on September 3rd, 2021. Reason: a couple of days earlier, Brian noted ["(I think we need :yakkiss:)"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/880934728428056648).

### Yakmail: *\*Ping\* You have mail!*

![yakmail](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/919968307212333116.png)

Since Serenity has an e-mail client, it's only logical that there's a mail-themed yak.

Created by Agni on December 13th 2021. Reason: After a lengthy unrelated discussion, Andreas pointed out that ["that sounds like the building blocks of blackmail"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830522505605283866/919916646326476861), to which GMTA responded ":yakmail:" and Agni created the emoji.

![yakoverflow](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/855122942097489970.png)

A pun on Stack Overflow, obviously. When the yak stack gets too large.

Created by Andreas on June 17th, 2021. Reason: Brian requested ["We need agni to make a yakoverflow icon, like the stack overflow logo :^)"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/855121465112395806) (private channel).

### Yakring: *One Ring to rule them all, / One Ring to find them,*

![yakring](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/924399473780736010.png)

*One Ring to bring them all / and in the darkness bind them* ~~(Sorry)~~. When some yak chain closes back in on itself, or just a reference to circular buffers.

Created by Andreas on December 25th, 2021. Reason: In a discussion about CI flakiness, Daniel commented [":yakcircularbuffer:"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830739873119207426/924387598116478976), referencing the fact that circular buffers in the Kernel might be the culprit for many of these fails and crashes. In response Andreas created :yakring: and [Agni first](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830739873119207426/924401950643093544) made the [Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings) reference replicated above.

### Yaksad: \*sheds a tear\*

![yaksad](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/920328207276867634.png)

A sad yak emoji similar to the Unicode ðŸ˜¢.

Created by Agni on December 14th, 2021. Reason: [Requested by Linus, originally under the name of `:sadyak:`](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/920323814917832705) (private channel). It was changed to `:yaksad:` to [make it consistent with the name of the other yak emotes and thus make it easier to autocomplete](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/920327908428492880) (private channel).

### Yakshed: ~~who tf even came up with this~~

![yakshed](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/866370560493223977.png)

A combination of yak shaving and bikeshedding. The latter refers to [procrastination or investing time into unimportant issues](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding) (as opposed to yakshaving, where time is invested into only _seemingly_ unimportant issues). The emoji can be used when the distinction is not exactly clear.

### Yakshrug: idk man

![yakshrug](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/870805412847443978.png)

Serenity's shrug emoji. People have mentioned that it looks kind of creepy.

Created by Agni on July 31st, 2021. Reason: Andreas responded to [their use of a shrug emoji](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830739873119207426/870797713439072308) with the then-non-existent yakshrug, which resulted in the creation of the emoji.

### Yakslice: \*surprised yak sounds\*

![yakslice](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/851188921881854012.png)

This yak was just split up. Used when things go wrong in general, or if the yak just got deeper.

Created by Agni on June 6th, 2021. Reason: symbols for the bot's LibJS test262 runner status, part of the _neoyak_ group. Here, it is used for all the tests that encounter a harness error. See [this message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/851180017261346866).

![yaksplode](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/851173158526517318.png)

Yak go boom. Similar in use to yakslice, used when things go wrong. Especially for crashes and the likes.

### Yakstack: But that's already on the stack

![yakstack](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/855017260779438091.png)

Refers to the stuff you want to do in Serenity, your to-do list etc. Used similar to yakoverflow, just in general when referencing all of the many things that are to be done.

Created by Andreas on June 17th, 2021. Reason: unknown. Various people used the term "yakstack" beforehand.

### Yaksteps: I can almost spot the yak in the distance.

![yaksteps](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/886305554736238654.png)

Baby steps, but involving yaks.

Alternate meaning: There's a yak hiding here. When something seems to lead to a shaveable yak, but you currently only see its traces.

Created by Andreas on September 11th, 2021. Reason: Checking all `VERIFY()`s in the Kernel is not a one-man job. Little by little - [:yaksteps:](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830739873119207426/886303238503170048)!

![yakthonk](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/877928647300898856.png)
