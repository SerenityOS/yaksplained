# Yaksplained – All the SerenityOS Yaks, explained!

This heavily relates to [SerenityOS](http://www.serenityos.org).

## On Yakshaving and Serenity's Love of Yaks

Yakshaving refers to doing work that seems pointless but is necessary to achieve a goal later down the line. In the SerenityOS developer community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/serenity), yakshaving is pretty prevalent (after all, building a new operating system requires a bunch of seemingly pointless gruntwork). Yak kind of became synonymous with just "the thing that I'm working on" or "the Serenity-intenal project I have". Therefore, the entire yak thing got out of hand and quite quickly, the Unicode bison emoji (the closest thing to a yak) wasn't enough anymore. So people created more yak emojis. And more yak emojis. And more yak emojis...

## All the Yaks Explained

Note that most of this is based on my personal observations, and while I can remember about half of these being created, I'll most certainly be wrong in how they are used in one place or another. Order is alphabetical.

#### Regarding private channel links

Some complaints have come up about the links to private channels which explain the origins of various emojis. We have decided that providing any evidence here is better than providing no evidence, even if the only evidence is not publicly available. If you have a good reason, we (in particular kleines Filmröllchen) can provide you possibly censored screenshots of mentioned conversations.


### Api

All yaks in this list can be queried alongside their metadata using a JSON api:

https://yaksplained.org/api/v1/$name.json

### 8bityak: \*chiptune starts playing\*
![8bityak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/928632967545368616.png)

A retro yak for all your nostalgia needs.

Created by Sam on or before February 28th, 2013, added as an emoji by Andreas on January 6th, 2022. The yak was created by Sam for his [yak game](https://github.com/AtkinsSJ/yak) ([play online if you have flash](http://samatkins.co.uk/games/yak/)) [as part of a game jam in 2013](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/928700382551625818), and Andreas uncovered it on the date he created the emoji ([this message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/928630761626664971) (private channel)).

### Angelyak: \*choir sounds\*
![Angelyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/937662446871654450.png)

A holy yak. Used when someone did something really amazing or just saved your day, similar to :goldyak:.

Created by Andreas on January 31st, 2022. Reason: unknown, but [in response to the :yak: discussion](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830739873119207426/937710614283956294).

### Babyak: it's so cuuute
![Babyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/929500826240696350.png)

A baby-faced yak that represents very young people (or yaks, for that matter).

Created by Andreas on January 8th, 2022. Reason: in a discussion, he noticed that someone was [less than 15 years old](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/929499581123805184) (private channel), to which Daniel responded with ":babyak:" and Andreas created the emoji.

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD67`

### Buffyak: \*flexes muscles\*
![Buffyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/983340685774163998.png)

A yak with muscular arms, used for strong or impressive achievements as well as generally in relation to the Jakt programming language.

Created by MacDue on June 6th, 2022. Reason: After a lot of discussion and proposals of possible logos for the then very new Jakt language, MacDue half-jokingly created :buffyak: with the comment ["(Real) Jakt logo just leaked"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831144706079195176/983335941433356360).

### Goldyak: shineh shineh trophey
![Goldyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/894236717421318144.png)

A trophy-like shiny yak, for giving out awards when someone shaved a difficult yak.

Created by Andreas on October 3rd, 2021. Reason: In response to (probably) some bug fix description, he wrote ["if it works, that's a golden yak for you"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/886211697843531866/894235121933254696). Apparently it did work, because shortly after that, he posted the newly-created :goldyak:. The details here are a bit fuzzy, see [this message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/896476288167071824).

### Hairyak: How did this grow so fast?
![Hairyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/879749569964015646.png)

This one's a hairy yak to shave. Used for particularly difficult/cumbersome/long-winded problems.

Created by Agni on August 24th, 2021. Reason: Andreas requested a "particularly hairy yak" [(first message in the chain)](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/879746499108556881).

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD00`

### Hyperyakkie: HYPERPOGGIES
![Hyperyakkie](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1035641580666761297.png)

An extreme version of :yakkie:, where the yak has gained laser eyes in the tradition of "hyper" emojis.

Created by Andreas on October 29th, 2022. Reason: unknown, shared with Linus with the comment "oh btw I made this thing", [first public appearance](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/859531354219872266/1036392186272563260).

### Imminentyakshave: This yak's about to be shaved.
![Imminentyakshave](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/866030445388365884.png)

Shave incoming. Used for when you're about to solve/currently solving a problem. Or if you noticed a problem and want to solve it right now.

Created by Agni on July 17th, 2021. Reason: [requested by Andreas](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/865881764111450112). Also relevant: [the associated meme](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/867538791962378240).

### Neoyak: Hax0r
![Neoyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/851188922512048199.png)

Hacker terminal or coding-themed yak, for all your hacker needs. Used in conjunction with Terminal or pop culture hacker-related things. Also used as a ninja yak when something ninja-related comes up.

Created by Agni on June 6th, 2021. Reason: symbols for the bot's LibJS test262 runner status. Here, it is used for all the tests that caused a runner exception. Starting with [this message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/851168937131638784), and with encouragement by networkException a conversation commenced that led to the creation of custom emojis for all the test runner results. _These emojis will be referred to here as the neoyak group._

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD15`

### Ninyak: It hides in the shadows... and it's always faster than you.
![Ninyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/953755103591022602.png)

A ninja yak. The standard ninja emoji (:ninja:) has been in use for some time, also with the :ninjamerge: custom emoji, to express when somebody else was faster at something than you; you were "ninja'd". :ninjamerge: in particular is used when your PR was merged unexpectedly / unexpectedly fast.

Created by kleines Filmröllchen on March 16th, 2022. Reason: After Sam [ninja'd everyone on explaining WHF to a newcomer](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830522505605283866/953749358690594907), people reacted to his message with :ninja: as usual. Kleines then responded with "we need :ninjak:" and it was promptly created by him and added shortly afterwards. Though the name was proposed as 'nin**j**ak', it was originally added as 'nin**jy**ak' and later renamed to 'nin**y**ak' around April 7th, 2022.

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD22`

### Partyak: Congratulations!
![Partyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/901168038248874045.png)

This yak is having a party, compare to the default (i.e. Unicode) 🥳 emoji.

Created by Andreas on October 21st, 2021. Reason: [celebration of the :yakking: emoji](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830522505605283866/900713226810064967) (see below).

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD60`

### Reyakted: This yak is named \[REDACTED\], it was born on ■■■■■■■.
![Reyakted](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/896486220106956810.png)

(Note to the RFC editor: Insert an SCP joke here.)

Created by Linus on October 9th, 2021. Reason: After discussing the :goldyak: origins (see above) with [Linus' blacked-out screenshot](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/896476288167071824), Sam asked [":reyakted: emote wen?"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/896484164059156490) and Linus promptly created it.

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD08`

### Shavedyak: \*shivers\*
![Shavedyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/919968342368993301.png)

A completely shaved or even naked yak. The ultimate endpoint in the yakshaving sequence.

Created by Agni on December 13th, 2021. Reason: While he was working on yakmail (see below), he apparently deleted the entire hair, [creating shavedyak accidentally](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/919965580365287455). Linus was quick to point out that ["This is cursed, I'd be happy to add it as :shavedyak:"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/919966596460589096).

### Skeleyak: That's an old one.
![Skeleyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/851188921290457150.png)

[Image in SerenityOS/artwork](https://github.com/SerenityOS/artwork/blob/master/images/emotes/skeleyak.png)

When one of your yaks is really old or just has been sitting around for a long time.

Created by Agni on June 6th, 2021. Reason: symbols for the bot's LibJS test262 runner status, part of the _neoyak_ group. Here, it is used for all the tests that timed out. See [this message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/851176393000747089).

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD14`

### Sleepyak: Zzzzz...
![Sleepyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/870598400016535554.png)

Don't wake the yak. A general sleep emoji.

Created by Agni on July 30th, 2021. Reason: unknown. [First version's message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/870589889320742932).

### Thousandyakstare: Oh god, it's looking at me
![Thousandyakstare](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/931283776850505759.png)

The stare of a thousand yaks. Are they in anger or rage, or are they just annoyed or tired? I don't know.

Created by Andreas on January 13th, 2022. Reason: After discussing the transfer of this very repository to the SerenityOS organization, kleines Filmröllchen said ["I'll just scream at you when something's amiss, sound good?"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/931286643346927627) (private channel) and Andreas responded with the newly created emoji as "you \[kleines\] provided the perfect opportunity to try it out!". The idea for the emoji must be a bit older, because on January 5th Andreas responded to Tobias' [posting of a very complex CSS spec image](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525031720943627/928398680443224104) with the then-nonexistent :thousandyakstare:.

### Xmasyak: Yakky Holidays!
![Xmasyak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/915529868219940944.png)

A christmas-themed yak, partially inspired by the fact that many people add a santa hat to their avatar in December.

Created by Andreas before December 1st, 2021. Reason: probably the above, or the question for a "SerenityOS Winter Holiday Theme". [This message](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830522505605283866/915406501760348170) is the first to include xmasyak as a reaction.

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CDB0`

### Yak: This should be obvious.
![Yak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/937708766844043334.png)

Just the standard yak emoji, which originally is the bison emoji from the [open-source Twitter emoji set "Twemoji"](https://twemoji.twitter.com/)

As Discord normally uses this emoji set, it became the template for all the other yak emojis. However, on iOS, 🦬 (bison) instead looks like this:

![iOS bison](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/830739873119207426/937709746402787398/unknown.png)

For this reason, Andreas [added the Twemoji bison as :yak:](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830739873119207426/937708898750722109) on January 31st, 2022.

### Yakbait: Nerd Snipe.
![Yakbait](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/873672505309679758.png)

A yak just baiting you to be shaved. Serenity's version of the [nerd snipe](https://xkcd.com/356/).

Created by Andreas on August 7th, 2021. Reason: Andrew commented ["don't yak bait me I'm trying to work on the build system lol"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/873671201262817290) (private channel). The similarity to the nerd snipe was first mentioned by networkException a couple of days later [(this message)](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/859531354219872266/875851312686825564).

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD07`

### Yakbane: *Was shaving yaks part of your plan?*
![Yakbane](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/931492399291723817.png)

A [The Dark Knight Rises](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1345836/) reference, usually accompanied by corresponding quotes.

Created by Andreas on January 14th, 2022. Reason: Agni made the first Dark Knight Rises reference [here](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830522505605283866/931479489584697344) and Andreas later created the emoji [in response](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830522505605283866/931492624274169866).

### Yakblush: \*turns red and starts to stutter\*
![Yakblush](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/921153579266498590.png)

A blushing yak emote like the Unicode 😊.

Created by Agni on December 16th, 2021. Reason: after discussing the ages of contributors, Brian remarked that ["Damn, serenity has a lot of Wunderkinds"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/921149719747625040) (private channel), to which Daniel responded with ":yakblush:". Agni quickly joined in with the newly created Yakblush emoji. [This](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830718394768162837/921724736009011251) is the first public message containing it.

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD63`

### Yakbrain: 5Head
![Yakbrain](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/853957472607273001.png)

That's smart. Comparable use to the 5Head emoji.

Created by Andreas on August 14th, 2021. Reason: unknown.

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD0A`

### Yakchain: \*stampede approaching\*
![Yakchain](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/887111540967366677.png)

There's a yak, that leads to another yak, that leads to another yak, ... and so on.

Created by Mustafa on September 13th, 2021. Reason: A discussion about blockchain and microkernels (don't ask).

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD91`

### Yakchill: cool down, cool down
![Yakchill](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1088822819183407154.png)

A very chill and relaxed yak, for when you need to calm down and take things less seriously.

Created by Agni on March 25th, 2023. Reason: Fabian noted that ["We need a generic :yakchill: and not only :chillkling:"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830522505605283866/1088818837086023681) since there evidently were too many hyper emojis and not enough chill emojis. Agni said "be careful what you wish for" and then created :yakchill:, which was promptly added.


### Yakcowboy: Yeeeeee-haw!
![Yakcowboy](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/941117006462197840.png)

A yak from the wild west. Also used for just hat-related things.

Created by Andreas on February 10th, 2022. Reason: In Linus' recent JS hacking video, functions came up that [had no spec comments](https://youtu.be/FS9ny-bV8Cw?t=517). Andreas referred to the time when strict spec compliance was not a thing in LibJS as ["the wild west days of LibJS"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830718394768162837/941116260803022928) and then created :yakcowboy:.

### Yakea: Everyone's favorite Swedish furniture.
![Yakea](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/888202246301569064.png)

A yak in the style of [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/), the infamous Swedish furniture company that has come to kind of (ironically and unironically) represent Sweden internationally. A reference to the fact that Andreas is Swedish.

Created by Linus on September 17th, 2021. Reason: In the discussion that ensued from the announcement of :yakid2: (see below), Sam mentioned that the emoji looked like ["Björn, the yak from Ikea"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/888193041091928074), to which Andreas responded "Yakea\*" and during a chain of Yak-Ikea-related jokes, Linus created the emoji.

Use in SerenityOS: `U+10CD16`

### Yakfire: \*smiles\* This is fine!
![Yakfire](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/860262878984536065.png)

Something just blew up/went wrong, or you found a fun bug. Can also be used as a "This is fine!" analog.

Created by Andreas on July 1st, 2021. Reason: Brian requested a ["Yak/Buggie wrapped in a warm blanket sipping Earl Grey in front of a fire emoji"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/851522357734408232/860261769577234452) and Andreas made yakfire instead because it wouldn't be as complicated. "Interpretation left to the viewer".

### Yakfused: Yak is confusion.

[Image in SerenityOS/artwork](https://github.com/SerenityOS/artwork/blob/master/images/emotes/yakfused.png)

Generic confusion emoji.

Created by Agni on June 8th, 2021. Reason: In response to an admittedly [weird comment by Ali](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/851522357734408232/851871356051521546), Agni used the non-existing catdogconfused, to which Andreas responded with the then-non-existing yakfused. This was promptly created by Agni.

### Yakgone: `404 Yak Not Found`
![Yakgone](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/935921684307902496.png)

For when your yak has strangely (or on purpose) disappeared.

Created by Agni on January 26th, 2022. Reason: After posting just a razor emoji (which is part of :imminentyakshave:), stefanos asked: ["where's the yak you are shaving?"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/935918380463030272) and Agni responded with the :yakgone: design.

### Yakid2: CSS is my passion
![Yakid2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/888189245594931202.png)

~~oh god where do I start~~ [ACID2](https://www.webstandards.org/files/acid2/test.html) is a popular test page that tests the compliance of a web browser, mainly CSS. The test is set up in such a way that only when the browser is (almost) compliant, a perfect smiley face will appear; otherwise, elements of the face are shifted, wrongly sized etc. For some time now, an ACID2 emoji :acid2:has existed on the server, demonstrating Browser's current compliance level. As to be expected, it still looks pretty bad:
![acid2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/908128059687837776.png)
Yakid2 is then just a yak emoji in the vein of the ACID2 emoji.

### Yakkie: POGGIES
![Yakkie](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/933441581258768394.png)

A yak version of the POGGIES emote popular on Twitch. Used to show excitement.

Created by Andreas on January 19th, 2022. Reason: After discussing the newly created yaksticker emoji, [he created yakkie](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/933441999846129725), probably to celebrate people's excitement about the sticker's introduction [in the shop](https://store.serenityos.org/listing/yak-sticker?product=794). The name is not yakkies, as would be expected from adopting the Twitch meme, instead the name yakkie reflects the other, much older server emote :poggie:

![poggie](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/838468228279828500.png)

 which is another poggies emote that is one of the most popular emotes on the server in general.

Delicious, approved by yak. Used as a replacement for the chef kiss emoji (which also exists on the server), in particular when relating to code.

Created by Andreas on September 3rd, 2021. Reason: a couple of days earlier, Brian noted ["(I think we need :yakkiss:)"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/880934728428056648).

Since Serenity has an e-mail client, it's only logical that there's a mail-themed yak.

Created by Agni on December 13th 2021. Reason: After a lengthy unrelated discussion, Andreas pointed out that ["that sounds like the building blocks of blackmail"](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830522505605283866/919916646326476861), to which GMTA responded ":yakmail:" and Agni created the emoji.

It was changed to `:yaksad:` to [make it consistent with the name of the other yak emotes and thus make it easier to autocomplete](https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/920327908428492880) (private channel).

![Yakshed](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/866370560493223977.png)

A combination of yak shaving and bikeshedding. The latter refers to [procrastination or investing time into unimportant issues](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding) (as opposed to yakshaving, where time is invested into only _seemingly_ unimportant issues). The emoji can be used when the distinction is not exactly clear.
