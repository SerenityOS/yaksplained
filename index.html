<h1 id="yaksplained--all-the-serenityos-yaks-explained">Yaksplained – All the SerenityOS Yaks, explained!</h1>
<p>This heavily relates to <a href="http://www.serenityos.org">SerenityOS</a>.</p>
<h2 id="on-yakshaving-and-serenitys-love-of-yaks">On Yakshaving and Serenity's Love of Yaks</h2>
<p>Yakshaving refers to doing work that seems pointless but is necessary to achieve a goal later down the line. In the SerenityOS developer community on <a href="https://discord.gg/serenity">Discord</a>, yakshaving is pretty prevalent (after all, building a new operating system requires a bunch of seemingly pointless gruntwork). Yak kind of became synonymous with just "the thing that I'm working on" or "the Serenity-intenal project I have". Therefore, the entire yak thing got out of hand and quite quickly, the Unicode bison emoji (the closest thing to a yak) wasn't enough anymore. So people created more yak emojis. And more yak emojis. And more yak emojis...</p>
<h2 id="all-the-yaks-explained">All the Yaks Explained</h2>
<p>Note that most of this is based on my personal observations, and while I can remember about half of these being created, I'll most certainly be wrong in how they are used in one place or another. Order is alphabetical.</p>

<h4 id="regarding-private-channel-links">Regarding private channel links</h4>
<p>Some complaints have come up about the links to private channels which explain the origins of various emojis. We have decided that providing any evidence here is better than providing no evidence, even if the only evidence is not publicly available. If you have a good reason, we (in particular kleines Filmröllchen) can provide you possibly censored screenshots of mentioned conversations.</p>

<p>A baby-faced yak that represents very young people (or yaks, for that matter).</p>
<p>Created by Andreas on January 8th, 2022. Reason: in a discussion, he noticed that someone was <a href="https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/929499581123805184">less than 15 years old</a> (private channel), to which Daniel responded with ":babyak:" and Andreas created the emoji.</p>

<p>A trophy-like shiny yak, for giving out awards when someone shaved a difficult yak.</p>
<p>Created by Andreas on October 3rd, 2021. Reason: In response to (probably) some bug fix description, he wrote <a href="https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/886211697843531866/894235121933254696">"if it works, that's a golden yak for you"</a>. Apparently it did work, because shortly after that, he posted the newly-created :goldyak:. The details here are a bit fuzzy, see <a href="https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/896476288167071824">this message</a>.</p>

<p>Hacker terminal or coding-themed yak, for all your hacker needs. Used in conjunction with Terminal or pop culture hacker-related things. Also used as a ninja yak when something ninja-related comes up.</p>
<p>Created by Agni on June 6th, 2021. Reason: symbols for the bot's LibJS test262 runner status. Here, it is used for all the tests that caused a runner exception. Starting with <a href="https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/851168937131638784">this message</a>, and with encouragement by networkException a conversation commenced that led to the creation of custom emojis for all the test runner results. <em>These emojis will be referred to here as the neoyak group.</em></p>

<p>A ninja yak. The standard ninja emoji (:ninja:) has been in use for some time, also with the :ninjamerge: custom emoji, to express when somebody else was faster at something than you; you were "ninja'd". :ninjamerge: in particular is used when your PR was merged unexpectedly / unexpectedly fast.</p>
<p>Created by kleines Filmröllchen on March 16th, 2022. Reason: After Sam <a href="https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830522505605283866/953749358690594907">ninja'd everyone on explaining WHF to a newcomer</a>, people reacted to his message with :ninja: as usual. Kleines then responded with "we need :ninjak:" and it was promptly created by him and added shortly afterwards. Though the name was proposed as 'nin<strong>j</strong>ak', it was originally added as 'nin<strong>jy</strong>ak' and later renamed to 'nin<strong>y</strong>ak' around April 7th, 2022.</p>

<p>The stare of a thousand yaks. Are they in anger or rage, or are they just annoyed or tired? I don't know.</p>
<p>Created by Andreas on January 13th, 2022. Reason: After discussing the transfer of this very repository to the SerenityOS organization, kleines Filmröllchen said <a href="https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/831544568767578162/931286643346927627">"I'll just scream at you when something's amiss, sound good?"</a> (private channel) and Andreas responded with the newly created emoji as "you [kleines] provided the perfect opportunity to try it out!". The idea for the emoji must be a bit older, because on January 5th Andreas responded to Tobias' <a href="https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525031720943627/928398680443224104">posting of a very complex CSS spec image</a> with the then-nonexistent :thousandyakstare:.</p>

<p>Created by Andreas before December 1st, 2021. Reason: probably the above, or the question for a "SerenityOS Winter Holiday Theme". <a href="https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830522505605283866/915406501760348170">This message</a> is the first to include xmasyak as a reaction.</p>

<p>Just the standard yak emoji, which originally is the bison emoji from the <a href="https://twemoji.twitter.com/">open-source Twitter emoji set "Twemoji"</a></p>
<p>As Discord normally uses this emoji set, it became the template for all the other yak emojis. However, on iOS, 🦬 (bison) instead looks like this:</p>

<p>A yak from the wild west. Also used for just hat-related things.</p>
<p>Created by Andreas on February 10th, 2022. Reason: In Linus' recent JS hacking video, functions came up that <a href="https://youtu.be/FS9ny-bV8Cw?t=517">had no spec comments</a>. Andreas referred to the time when strict spec compliance was not a thing in LibJS as <a href="https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830718394768162837/941116260803022928">"the wild west days of LibJS"</a> and then created :yakcowboy:.</p>

<p>Created by Linus on September 17th, 2021. Reason: In the discussion that ensued from the announcement of :yakid2: (see below), Sam mentioned that the emoji looked like <a href="https://discord.com/channels/830522505605283862/830525235803586570/888193041091928074">"Björn, the yak from Ikea"</a>, to which Andreas responded "Yakea*" and during a chain of Yak-Ikea-related jokes, Linus created the emoji.</p>

As to be expected, it still looks pretty bad: <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/908128059687837776.png" alt="acid2" /> Yakid2 is then just a yak emoji in the vein of the ACID2 emoji.</p>

<p>Created by Andreas on January 19th, 2022.

The name is not yakkies, as would be expected from adopting the Twitch meme, instead the name yakkie reflects the other, much older server emote :poggie:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/838468228279828500.png" alt="poggie" /></p>

<p>A combination of yak shaving and bikeshedding. The latter refers to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">procrastination or investing time into unimportant issues</a> (as opposed to yakshaving, where time is invested into only <em>seemingly</em> unimportant issues). The emoji can be used when the distinction is not exactly clear.</p>
