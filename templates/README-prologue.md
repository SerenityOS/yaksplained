# Yaksplained â€“ All the SerenityOS Yaks, explained!

This heavily relates to [SerenityOS](http://www.serenityos.org).

## On Yakshaving and Serenity's Love of Yaks

Yakshaving refers to doing work that seems pointless but is necessary to achieve a goal later down the line. In the SerenityOS developer community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/serenity), yakshaving is pretty prevalent (after all, building a new operating system requires a bunch of seemingly pointless gruntwork). Yak kind of became synonymous with just "the thing that I'm working on" or "the Serenity-intenal project I have". Therefore, the entire yak thing got out of hand and quite quickly, the Unicode bison emoji (the closest thing to a yak) wasn't enough anymore. So people created more yak emojis. And more yak emojis. And more yak emojis...
